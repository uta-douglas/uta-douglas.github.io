Every 6 months we have a major tabletop exercise to challenge a particular area of OIT. This time we will be combining the effort with Information Security office to make this a joint exercise. Ground Rules Timing The exercise will be two hours long with a 30-minute recap session. The exercise takes place in real time. Additional information may become available during the exercise in the form of \"injections\". Participants The participants will meet in a specific location but should simulate their normal workspace including access to laptop and other resources. Facilitators The facilitators will provide scenario information and be able to answer questions related to the simulated event. Conspirators A list of conspirators will be made available. These conspirators will be given specific scenario details if called upon by participants. They would typically not be in the room but available via chat, email, or phone to simulate a real world experience.","title":"Participant Home"},{"location":"#tabletop-exercise","text":"","title":"Tabletop Exercise"},{"location":"#exec-summary","text":"Feburary 13, 2026 - Today's event is part of OIT's regular cadence to test out the Business Continuity Plan.
