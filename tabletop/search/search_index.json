Every 6 months we have a major tabletop exercise to challenge a particular area of OIT. This time we will be combining the effort with Information Security office to make this a joint exercise. Ground Rules Timing The exercise will be two hours long with a 30-minute recap session. The exercise takes place in real time. Additional information may become available during the exercise in the form of \"injections\". Participants The participants will meet in a specific location but should simulate their normal workspace including access to laptop and other resources. Facilitators The facilitators will provide scenario information and be able to answer questions related to the simulated event. Conspirators A list of conspirators will be made available. These conspirators will be given specific scenario details if called upon by participants. They would typically not be in the room but available via chat, email, or phone to simulate a real world experience.","title":"Participant Home"},{"location":"#tabletop-exercise","text":"","title":"Tabletop Exercise"},{"location":"#exec-summary","text":"Feburary 13, 2026 - Today's event is part of OIT's regular cadence to test out the Business Continuity Plan.

Sometimes the page loads perfectly, but other times, after I enter my credentials and approve the Push notification on my phone, the browser just spins indefinitely and eventually lands on a \"Connection Reset\" error page. I have tried switching from Chrome to Firefox, and the issue persists across both browsers. My Research Assistant in the ERB building is having the same problem, though a colleague down the hall in the same department seems to be working just fine. This inconsistency is making it impossible to determine if the issue is with my laptop or the University network. Please investigate immediately as this is time-sensitive.","title":"INC 88421"},{"location":"INC-88421/#description","text":"I am currently attempting to finalize a grant submission due by COB today, but I am experiencing bizarre connectivity issues with the Okta login page.
