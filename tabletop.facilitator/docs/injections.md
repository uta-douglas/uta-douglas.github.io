# Injects & Flow:

* [Injection 1](/tabletop/injection1/): T+0 (Symptoms): Service Desk reports "random" login failures. Some users connect fine (their traffic stayed symmetric), others fail.
* [Injection 2](/tabletop/injection2/) T+30 (Network Discovery): Network team sees the SRX cluster status flapping or "Dual Active" errors in the logs.
* [Injection 3](/tabletop/injection3/)T+45 (Security Twist): Security Ops sees a massive spike in "Deny" logs on the ERB-SRX for legitimate return traffic, initially looking like a DDoS or spoofing attack.
